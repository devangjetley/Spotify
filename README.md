Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing a dataset of Spotify tracks to extract meaningful insights related to music trends, artist performance, and track characteristics. The analysis is conducted using SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data effectively.

Key Insights:
- Identification of the top tracks based on streaming numbers.
- Analysis of artist contributions and track releases over the years.
- Examination of playlist inclusion across multiple platforms.
- Exploration of musical attributes such as BPM, energy levels, and mode classifications.

Research Questions:
1) What are the top 10 tracks with the highest number of streams?
2) Which artist has the most tracks in the dataset, and how many tracks do they have?
3) How many tracks were released each year?
4) What percentage of tracks are included in Spotify, Apple, and Deezer playlists?
5) What is the average BPM (beats per minute) of tracks released in each year?
6) What are the Top 5 Most Streamed Tracks Released in Each Year?
7) How many tracks are classified as major vs. minor mode?
8) Which tracks have consistently appeared in the top charts across Spotify, Apple, and Deezer?
9) What is the average energy level of tracks by artist?
10) How has the average energy level of tracks changed from year to year?

Tools Used:
- SQL: For querying and manipulating data.
- MySQL: For database management and data analysis.

Dataset Information:
The dataset includes various attributes such as track name, artist name, release date, streaming counts, playlist inclusions, and musical characteristics (BPM, energy levels, mode).

Conclusion:
The analysis provides valuable insights into music trends on Spotify, highlighting popular tracks, artist contributions, and musical features that resonate with listeners. This project serves as a foundation for further exploration into music data analytics.
